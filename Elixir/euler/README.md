# Euler

Solutions for Euler problems written in elixir. This code comes with a module named `Benchmark` which contains the `time` function for calculating the execution time of a problem.

simply start a REPL with `iex -S mix` and call `Euler.problem#` to run a solution directly or `Benchmark.time(&Euler.problem#/0)` to time the execution.
